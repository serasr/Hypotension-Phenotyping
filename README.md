# Exploring Patient Phenotypes in the Profound Hypotension Cohort


#### This is a part of assingments of ML applications in health elective at Unimelb.
#### Individual work completed by SeraSR.



### This Jupyter notebook conducts an in-depth analysis of hypotension cohort, focusing on identifying distinct patient subgroups within it. The primary objective is to explore patient heterogeneity and assess whether meaningful clusters emerge based on demographic, clinical, and outcome-related features.


 ## Problem Statement

Understanding patient heterogeneity is crucial in healthcare, as it enables more personalized and effective medical interventions. This notebook aims to address the following questions:

•	Can we identify distinct patient subgroups within a critical care cohort based on available data?
•	Do these identified subgroups exhibit variations in patient outcomes, such as mortality rates and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU)?


 ## Notebook Details

•	Language: Python
•	Requirements: This notebook should run on most standard computing hardware. No specialized hardware like GPUs is required.


 ## How to Use

1.	Open the Jupyter notebook: `hypotension_phenotype_main.ipynb`.
2.	Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the analysis.
3.	Review the findings and insights within the notebook to gain a better understanding of patient phenotypes in the given cohort.


## Abstract

This research endeavours to unravel the intricate landscape of patient heterogeneity within a critical care cohort by employing advanced data analysis techniques. Leveraging demographic, clinical, and outcome-related data, this study applies clustering algorithms to unveil distinct patient subgroups. The analysis yields two prominent clusters characterized by unique patient profiles, including age, severity of illness, comorbidity indices, and gender. Significantly, these clusters exhibit marked variations in patient outcomes, notably in terms of mortality rates and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). These findings underscore the potential clinical relevance of such clustering approaches in critical care, highlighting the importance of tailored patient management strategies. Nonetheless, this research also suggests future avenues for exploration, including more extensive feature engineering, the application of advanced machine learning models, temporal analyses, and predictive modelling to enhance patient care. Ethical considerations, external validation, and real-time monitoring are also essential facets of future investigations to ensure the ethical and practical applicability of these findings in diverse healthcare settings. In essence, this study sheds light on the complex landscape of patient phenotypes in critical care, offering a foundation for more personalized and effective healthcare interventions. 

## Data source

A sample dataset has been provided named "hypotension_patients.csv" to preserve copyright integrity.
The whole analysis has been conducted on 5000+ patient data.

## Key Findings

The analysis reveals two prominent patient clusters with distinct characteristics. Cluster 0 is characterized by younger age, lower severity of illness, and higher comorbidity indices, while Cluster 1 includes older patients with higher illness severity. Notably, these clusters exhibit significant differences in patient outcomes, highlighting the potential clinical relevance of patient stratification.



### By opening this notebook, you'll gain valuable insights into patient heterogeneity in critical care, potentially paving the way for more effective healthcare interventions tailored to specific patient profiles.
